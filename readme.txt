This plugin provides a handy widget to analyze a person's personality based on their twitter handle.

== Description ==

Humans have long been advised to "know thyself" but the truth is that we may not know ourselves as well as we think we do. While you may be good at recognizing your feelings, your perception of your personality is probably not really all that accurate. In fact, your personality is better judged by how other people - friends and even strangers - perceive you. Enter your Twitter handle or the handles of friends, coworkers, celebrities, and politicians and learn about their personalities, emotions, the way they think, make decisions, and more. Or hardcode a Twitter handle into the plugin and create a real-time dashboard of that handle's psychology.
